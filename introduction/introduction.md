# Introduction

## About this Workshop
In this Lab, You will learn how to setup Active Data Guard. You will using a compute instance in OCI to simulate the primary database, which is deployed in one region (For example: Seoul). Another compute instance in OCI to simulate the standby database which can be deployed in another region (For example: Tokyo). The primary and the standby database communicate through public internet. 

Estimated Lab Time: 4 hours. 

### About Product/Technology
Oracleâ€™s Maximum Availability Architecture (Oracle MAA) is the best practices blueprint for data protection and availability for Oracle databases deployed on private, public or hybrid clouds. Data Guard and Active Data Guard provide disaster recovery (DR) for databases with recovery time objectives (RTO) that cannot be met by restoring from backup. Customers use these solutions to deploy one or more synchronized replicas (standby databases) of a production database (the primary database) in physically separate locations to provide high availability, comprehensive data protection, and disaster recovery for mission-critical data.

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Provision a primary and standby environment for ADG.
* Setup the ADG between primary and standby.
* Test the ADG including DML redirection and switchover.
* Failover and reinstate the instance.

### Prerequisites
* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
